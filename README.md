## Developer Tutorials
My name is Jeremy Glebe. I am a software developer, student, and educator. I attend graduate school at University of North Texas and teach at a private K-12 school called Dexter.
When I was working on my undergraduate, I was a supplemental instructor for the Data Structures & ADT class. The professor wanted student to learn: to use lightweight editors, use compilation commands, and work in a unix terminal. So, I made these tutorials to help get students started.

I still love teaching and I still sometimes refer to these tutorials. I may add more tutorials to this repository in the future.

**Warning:** Some tutorials might be a bit dated. (Cygwin? When WSL is a thing?)
