# Developer Tool Tutorials
Tutorials on common developer tools for computer science students.

## Who am I?
My name is Jeremy Glebe. I am a software developer, a computer science student
at Midwestern State University, and a supplemental instructor for Data
Structures & ADT (also at MSU). I started writing tutorials on using common
tools and editors for the data structures students, but I have decided to
separate it into its own repository for any students to use.
