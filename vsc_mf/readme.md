# Visual Studio Code: Multiple File Compilation

## Problem
Unlike some IDE softwares (remember, vscode is not a full ide) Visual Studio
Code doesn't have any extremely clear methods to compile multiple files without
the user doing so manually. We can address this issue in a few different ways
which will be detailed below.

## Requirements
The following is assumed about your environment:
* You are using Visual Studio Code
* You have the Code Runner extension for vscode installed
    * only needed for one of the methods
* You have G++ installed and in your PATH

If any of the above assumptions are **not** true of your environment and you are
on Windows, [follow this tutorial.](https://github.com/jeremyglebe/dev_tool_tutorials/tree/master/win_vsc)

## 3 Methods of Multiple File Compilation
